# Biological Growth Simulator

A Java Swing Application to simulate the process of Tree Growth.

## Installation

We can use Terminal or IDE([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)). 

## To Run from Terminal: 

1. Clone the Repo.
2. ImportCan
3. Locate the Jar file in JARS folder.
4. Run the following command in the Terminal.

```bash
java -jar Biological-Growth.jar
```

## To Run from Eclipse/IntelliJ Idea/VSCode

1. Import the project.
2. Build the project
3. Run

## Manual -  Biological Growth
Built a Java Swing Application to show a Biological Growth of a Tree

The end-user has to input data: 
```
1. Color
2. Generation
3. Rule
4. Speed
5. Radian
6. Length Factor
```

### *Based on this Simulation begins.*

The User can pause the simulation and resume it also.
User has the functionality of ***RANDOM*** where he could set random pre-defined values
and could see various different simulations

### *COLORS:*
There are 5 colors: Black, Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. Users can choose anyone.
Users can change the color of the simulation in middle by pausing and changing the color.

### *GENERATIONS:*
Generations refer to the layers of child-stems. They decrease by the Length-Factor
set by the user.

### *RULE:*
***There are 3 rules:***

***Rule 1:*** Only two child-stems generated with length-factor given by end-User\
***Rule 2:*** Three Child-stems generated with one in middle\
***Rule 3:*** Four child-stems generated with 2 side stems and 2 middle stems

### *SPEED:*
***There are 4 settings of Speed/Progress:

***Direct Output:*** Shows the complete Tree at once without any delay - 0ms\
***Fast:*** Shows the Tree at once with small delay - 1ms\
***Normal:*** Shows the Tree at once with normal delay - 10ms\
***Slow:*** Shows the Tree at once with big delay - 50ms

### *RADIAN:*
There are 5 angles set from ***15°(π/12) to 90°(π/2)*** for the angle between stems.

### *LENGTH FACTOR:*
 There are 4 types of decrement from ***5% to 20%.***

### *START BUTTON:*
 ***To Start the simulations***
### *PAUSE BUTTON:*
***To Pause the simulation***
### *RESUME BUTTON:*
***To Resume the simulation***
### *RANDOM BUTTON:*
***To Randomise the simulation***
