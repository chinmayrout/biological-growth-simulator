ASSIGNMENT5 - BIOLOGICAL GROWTH

Made a Java Swing Application to show a Biological Growth of a Tree

User has to input data: COLOR, GENERATION, RULE, SPEED, RADIAN and LENGTH FACTOR.
Based on this Simulation begins.
User can pause the simulation and resume it also.
User has the functionality of RANDOM where he could set random pre-defined values
and could see various different simulations

COLORS:
There are 5 Colors: Black, Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. User can choose any one.
User can change color of the simulation in middle by pausing and changing the color.

GENERATIONS:
Generations refer to the layers of child-stems. They decrease by the Length-Factor
set by the user.

RULE: There are 3 rules:
Rule 1: Only two child-stems generated with length-factor given by end-User
Rule 2: Three Child-stems generated with one in middle
Rule 3: Four child-stems generated with 2 side stems and 2 middle stems

SPEED: There are 4 settings of Speed/Progress
Direct Output: Shows the complete Tree at once without any delay - 0ms
Fast: Shows the Tree at once with small delay - 1ms
Normal: Shows the Tree at once with normal delay - 10ms
Slow: Shows the Tree at once with big delay - 50ms

RADIAN: There are 5 angles set from 15°(π/12) to 90°(π/2) for angle between stems.

LENGTH FACTOR: There is 4 types of decrement from 5% to 20%.

START BUTTON - To Start the simulations
PAUSE BUTTON - To Pause the simulation
RESUME BUTTON - To Resume the simulation
RANDOM BUTTON - To Randomise the simulation
